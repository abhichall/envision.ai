## envision.ai - past data, future vision

envision.ai is a predictive intelligence platform designed to provide real-time risk assessments across multiple sectors, starting with wildfire prediction in California. Using a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical wildfire data and real-time weather inputs in the state of California, the platform forecasts wildfire likelihood for each county, helping communities, emergency responders, and policymakers make proactive decisions. While its current focus is wildfire risk mitigation, envision.ai is built for scalability, with plans to expand into predicting other environmental hazards like floods, pandemics, and even economic trends. Future enhancements will incorporate LLM-generated reports and advanced machine learning models to improve accuracy and provide deeper insights.

## Key Features:

Features an interactive risk map that visually represents wildfire likelihood across counties using a color-coded system. Users can click on a county to view a real-time wildfire risk forecast, helping them assess potential threats instantly. Additionally, hovering over a county displays its name and location details, enhancing navigation and usability
